Here's a step-by-step guide on how to install Python and Paramiko on Windows:

**1. Install Python:**
- Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/
- Click on the "Downloads" menu and choose the latest Python version compatible with your system (either Python 3.x or Python 2.x).
- Download the installer corresponding to your Windows version (32-bit or 64-bit).
- Run the downloaded installer.
- Check the box labeled "Add Python to PATH" during the installation process.
- Click "Install Now" to begin the installation.
- Python will be installed to your system. You can verify the installation by opening the command prompt and typing `python --version`.

**2. Install Paramiko:**
- Open the command prompt.
- Type the following command to install Paramiko using pip, the Python package installer:
  ```
  pip install paramiko
  ```
  If you have multiple versions of Python installed, make sure to use the correct version-specific pip command (e.g., `pip3` for Python 3).
- Pip will download and install Paramiko and its dependencies.
- Once the installation is complete, you can verify it by importing Paramiko in a Python script or by running `pip show paramiko` in the command prompt.

That's it! Python and Paramiko should now be installed on your Windows system. You can start using Paramiko in your Python scripts to interact with network devices via SSH.
